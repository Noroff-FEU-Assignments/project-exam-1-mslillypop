Gummybear Dragons Blog was my first year exam project. I am not entierly happy with the outcome of it as it does posess some technical hiccups and some things are not working as they should. This will hopefully be improved and sorted once I find the time to do so.

## Description

For the project exam I was tasked with creating a blog site. The topic and design was entirely up to me, but I had to follow the site architecture as follows:
- Home page
- About page
- List of blog posts
- Blog post specific pages
- Contact page

It had certain other requirements as well such as the blog posts needed to be dynamically fetched from an external wordpress API which I also set up. And it had to have a contact form verification system, which I failed a little bit at doing, as well as a scrollable carousel which I also failed to make fully functional. 

## Built With

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- WordpressApi
- Midjourney AI for the images
- ChatGPT for the blogpost contents

### Where to find the deployed site?
